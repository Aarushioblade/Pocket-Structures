The core is everything you need
to keep your base operational.

It can store a small amount of
energy and resources, and comes
with a mini power supply to
start off with.

It is also the only known
structure that can store
starbits, the rarest resource
in the galaxy.

Because of this, enemies will
try to destroy the core. If
they succeed, it is game over!
