Not a structure, but a threat to
your base that should be
destroyed as soon as possible.

Enemies originate from deep space
and feed on starbits, which is
unfortunate because the Core
is filled with them.

While the Core is their main
target, they will destroy anything
that gets in their way.

As you accumulate more starbits,
enemies will attack more
frequently. This will even begin
to attract enemies from the
deeper sectors, where they are
known to be more powerful.

Keep your Core safe at all costs!
