Fires a high-energy beam at
enemies, dealing a tremendous
amount of damage.

The latest advances in energy
storage and consumption have led
to the hyperbeam, an incredibly
powerful structure. With its high
range and high damage output, it
can defend any base with ease -
as long as it remains charged.

Though only for a brief moment,
the energy needed to fire the
hyperbeam is enormous. To account
for these sudden drops in energy,
it is recommended to build power
boxes to stabilize energy flow.
