A simple structure that generates
energy for your base.

As you build more structures,
power generated by the Core will
not be enough to meet growing
energy demands. This is where
building generators becomes
essential.

Generators are highly volatile,
and as a result, have low
structural integrity. If an
enemy should reach an
unprotected generator, it may
have severe consequences on
your base...!
