Generates a force field that
surrounds nearby structures,
which protects from enemy
attacks.

When an enemy attacks a shielded
structure, it has to break through
that shield first before it can
damage the building. From its
design, a shield can completely
protect structures from weak
enemy attacks.

While shields are more effective
at defending than regenerators,
they have a slightly lower range,
a very low amount of health,
and consume extremely high
amounts of energy. Field strength
dissipates rapidly if the shield
loses power, and shields cannot
regenerate any health.
