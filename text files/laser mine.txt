Mines for raw materials using the
latest cutting-edge technology.

Laser mines lock onto passing
asteroids and extract raw material
from them, which can be collected
and then stored to nearby
structures.

These structures require a high
amount of energy, so building
generators is recommended.

The material it produces is
commonly used in starbit
production, though it could
potentially be used as
ammunition, or regeneration...
