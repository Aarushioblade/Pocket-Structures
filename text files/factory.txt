Converts raw materials into the
highly-prized resources known as
starbits.

The conversion process requires a
medium amount of energy, and takes
in more material than the amount
of starbits it produces. While it
is an expensive process, it's
exactly why starbits are so
valuable.

Starbits are the primary currency
for buying and upgrading your
structures. They also raise the
threat level of enemies, so be
careful!
