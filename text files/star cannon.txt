Launches projectiles at enemies
to destroy them.

The star cannon needs a bit of
material for ammunition, as well
as energy to propel it. Luckily,
it will only attempt to consume
resources when it detects enemies
within attack range.

Researchers across the galaxy are
looking for destroyed enemies, in
the interest of building stronger
weapons against them. Thus, any
enemies you destroy can be sold
for starbits!
